Semantics: HTML5 introduces new semantic elements like <header>, <nav>, <section>, <article>, <footer>, and <aside>. These elements provide a clearer structure to web documents, making it easier to understand their content.

Multimedia Support: HTML5 includes native support for audio and video playback without the need for third-party plugins. The <audio> and <video> elements allow developers to embed media directly into web pages.

Canvas: The <canvas> element allows for dynamic, scriptable rendering of 2D shapes and bitmap images. This feature is especially useful for creating interactive graphics and animations.

Offline Web Applications: HTML5 introduces the Application Cache (AppCache) and Web Storage (localStorage and sessionStorage) to enable web applications to work offline or with reduced connectivity. This is achieved by caching resources locally on the user's device.

Responsive Design: HTML5 provides support for creating responsive web designs with features like the <meta> viewport tag, which helps optimize web pages for various devices and screen sizes.

New Form Input Types: HTML5 introduces new input types such as email, url, tel, number, date, and more, providing better input validation and user experience for forms.

Web Workers: HTML5 enables the use of web workers, allowing developers to run scripts in the background, separate from the main execution thread. This enhances performance and responsiveness by handling tasks concurrently.

Geolocation: HTML5 includes the Geolocation API, which allows web applications to access the user's location information (with permission). This feature is commonly used in mapping and location-based services.

Drag and Drop: HTML5 simplifies drag-and-drop functionality with native support, making it easier for users to interact with and manipulate content on web pages.

Enhanced Accessibility: HTML5 introduces several features to improve web accessibility, including the <nav>, <article>, and <section> elements, ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) roles, and more.

Cross-document Messaging: HTML5 allows communication between documents from different domains using the postMessage API, facilitating seamless integration of content from multiple sources.
