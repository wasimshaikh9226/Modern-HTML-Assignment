HTML entities are special codes used to represent characters that have a specific meaning in HTML, such as reserved characters or characters that may not render properly in browsers. They are typically used to display characters that have a special significance in HTML or to represent characters that are not easily typable on a standard keyboard. HTML entities start with an ampersand (&) and end with a semicolon (;).

Here are five commonly used HTML entities:

&lt; - Less Than Sign (<):
Represents the less than symbol (<). Used to display the less than sign without the browser interpreting it as the beginning of an HTML tag.

&gt; - Greater Than Sign (>):
Represents the greater than symbol (>). Used to display the greater than sign without the browser interpreting it as the end of an HTML tag.

&amp; - Ampersand (&):
Represents the ampersand symbol (&). Used to display the ampersand without the browser interpreting it as the beginning of an HTML entity.

&quot; - Double Quote ("):
Represents the double quote symbol ("). Used to display double quotes without the browser interpreting them as the beginning or end of an HTML attribute.

&copy; - Copyright Symbol (©):
Represents the copyright symbol (©). Used to display the copyright symbol in HTML.
